## [Unreleased]

### Added

**Milestone M0 — workspace**

- Cargo workspace with the ten `sipx-*` crates, shared lints (`unsafe_code = "forbid"`)
  and `MIT OR Apache-2.0` licensing.
- CI: rustfmt, clippy (`-D warnings`), tests, MSRV check, `cargo-deny`, a fuzz smoke run, and
  a provenance gate that fails rather than passing when unconfigured.

**Milestone M1 — the sans-IO SIP core (`sipx-sip`)**

- Specs first: `docs/specs/sip-message.md`, `sip-parser.md` and `sip-transaction.md`, with
  every normative statement either citing an RFC section or marked as a project decision with
  its rationale.
- The RFC 4475 torture corpus, recovered bit-exactly from that RFC's Appendix A archive by
  `scripts/import-rfc4475-corpus.sh` and classified by which layer must object to each
  message. Green across all four layers.
- `Uri`, `Host`/`HostName`, `HeaderName` and parameter lists, with RFC 3261 §19.1.4
  equivalence — deliberately *not* `PartialEq`, since that relation is not transitive.
- A zero-copy message model: parsed messages borrow their bytes and re-serialize byte for
  byte, including original spelling, compact forms, whitespace and line folding.
- One parser for datagram and stream framing, verified identical by splitting every corpus
  message at every byte offset. Fuzz targets for both, seeded from the corpus.
- Typed headers parsed on demand, distinguishing absent from present-and-malformed.
- Message validation returning a list of findings, with `Max-Forwards` marked repairable.
- Builders in which header injection is unrepresentable rather than validated against.
- All four transaction state machines (RFC 3261 §17, amended by RFC 6026), matching with the
  RFC 2543 fallback, and transaction stores with a leak test.

**Milestone M2 — transports and the user agent**

- `docs/specs/sip-transport.md`, settling the connection-reuse and backpressure decisions.
- One event loop per endpoint owning the transaction layer, the timer queue and the sockets;
  no locks in the signalling path.
- UDP with `received`/`rport` (RFC 3581), and the RFC 3261 §18.1.1 datagram size guard.
- TCP with per-connection stream framing and a pool that distinguishes inbound from outbound
  connections, so a response returns the way it came without an inbound connection becoming a
  route for unrelated outbound requests.
- RFC 3263 resolution — NAPTR, SRV with RFC 2782 weighting, A/AAAA — behind a trait, with a
  seeded RNG so the weighted distribution is asserted rather than assumed. No DNS client is
  wired in yet; see `T-5`.
- Digest authentication (RFC 7616): MD5, MD5-sess, SHA-256, SHA-256-sess, verified against
  the digest RFC 2617 publishes for its own worked example.
- Registration as a lease: the registrar's granted expiry wins, refreshes reuse the `Call-ID`
  and advance the `CSeq`, and a rejected password fails once instead of looping.
- `OPTIONS` answered with a real capability list.
